## Project Proposal

`Project Name`: Fitness Calculator
`Team Name`: FitCalc
`Team Members`: Peyton Skwarczynski

## Description

This application will be able to compute serveral fitness calculations pertainting to many different exercises.

By using a set of 5 different equations, this calculator is able to compute:
- Required duration of a particular workout
- Total calories burned by working out
- Body Fat Percentage
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Required Daily Consumption of Calories / Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

This project is important because of the many factors that affect the quality of a workout. Variables such as intensity, duration, height, and weight play a significant role in the quality of performance. 

Many people have extremely busy lives where they often don't have much time, if any, to workout. Because of this, you want to make sure you are getting the most out your limited time being active.

This Fitness Calculator serves the solution to this worldwide problem. By combining many different workout factors into a single calculator, people have a simple way to compute any variable they may desire.

## On Startup

- The user will be prompted with a question, asking what variable they are looking to calculate.

- Depending on the selected variable, the interface will be updated with corresponding nodes requesting the user to input the personal data required to make such calculation

- After entering required information, the user can make the calculation by clicking on the "Calculate" button

- Post-calculation, more nodes will appear in the interface to show the results of the specific computation

## Next Steps?

After making the first calculation, the user has one of three options
- The user may click the "X" button in the top right corner to exit the program.
- The user may click the "Reset Fields" button in the bottom left of the screen to clear the inputted values, and make another calculation with the same query.
- The user may click the "Make a Different Calculation" button in the bottom right of the screen to clear all nodes pertaining to the initial calculation, and allow the user to select a new calculation option at the top middle of the screen.

## Other Functionalities

- If the user wants to switch calculation option before making the first computation, simply select the "Make a Different Calculation" button

- If the user inputs any non-number value into any of the text boxes, an error message will appear, promping the user to only input number values

## Plan and Estimate of Effort

This calculator has a lot of different variables that can be calculated from a small list of user inputted data. That being said, I will initially work on implementing the specific formulas. From that point on, I will need to create an efficient GUI that asks the user to input the data needed to successfully execute the computation.
